# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset

This project focuses on breast cancer classification using deep learning techniques applied to ultrasound images. The dataset is first extracted and preprocessed, ensuring proper organization and labeling. The images are then split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model learning and evaluation. Data augmentation techniques are applied using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` to enhance the model's robustness. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, including label distribution visualization and sample image previews, to better understand the dataset before training.

A custom deep learning model is built using DenseNet121, a powerful pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is fine-tuned by adding fully connected layers and dropout regularization to optimize performance while preventing overfitting. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. Performance metrics, including training accuracy and validation accuracy, are monitored throughout the training process. The training and validation loss curves are visualized to assess the modelâ€™s learning behavior over multiple epochs.

After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its classification accuracy. A confusion matrix is generated to analyze misclassifications, and a detailed classification report is provided to assess precision, recall, and F1-score across different classes. Finally, the model is used for real-world predictions, classifying unseen images while displaying true and predicted labels along with confidence scores. This project serves as a foundation for using deep learning in medical imaging and can be further improved with additional data and model enhancements.
